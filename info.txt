Trust this meets you well?!
Go through the undergraduate.html, Ion know if you understand what I'm trying to do there already


It's just when undergrad is picked, it should display all undergrad info, if PT is picked, it displays pt info, instead of having different pages

Shey you get??

I'll try and bring the other contents in later when I'm less busy or not

Thanks in advance my man, Have a great day ahead!
